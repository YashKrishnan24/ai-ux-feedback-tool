- Checks sentence length and complexity
- Suggests improvements if text is too hard or too simple

### 2️⃣ CTA Effectiveness Analysis
- Detects action verbs (e.g., Buy, Start, Join, Download)
- Identifies weak or generic CTAs
- Scores based on action-oriented language strength

### 3️⃣ Color Contrast Analysis
- Converts HEX colors to RGB
- Calculates brightness difference
- Evaluates accessibility compliance
- Suggests improvements for better readability

### 4️⃣ Final UX Score
Weighted combination of:
- Readability
